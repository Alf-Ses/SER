name: emozionalmente
description: 'Emozionalmente is an extensive, crowdsourced Italian emotional speech
  corpus. The dataset consists of 6902 labeled samples acted out by 431 amateur actors
  while verbalizing 18 different sentences expressing the Big Six emotions (anger,
  disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise) plus neutrality. Labels represent the emotional
  communicative intention of the actors (i.e., the seven emotional states). Recordings
  were generally obtained with non-professional equipment. They are .wav files, mono-channel,
  and have a sample size of 16 bits and a sample rate of 16000 Hz. Each audio recording
  lasts 3.81 seconds (SD = 0.99 seconds). The emotional content of the clips were
  validated by asking 829 humans (5 evaluations per audio) to guess the emotion contained
  in each recording. Humans obtained a general accuracy of 66%. '
